# Quote-Generator

This is the 5th project made during my front end developer course.

The project was to make a random silly quote generator.

There needed to be free seperate part of sentences for the app to then choose a first part of sentence, a second and a last to create a random silly quote. The quotes didn't need to make any sense.

This project was the first JS project of the course.
